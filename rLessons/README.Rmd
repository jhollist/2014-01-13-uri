Software Carpentry R Bootcamp - URI R Lessons
========================================================

*Note: This material is a mash-up from Jenny Bryan's [course materials on r] (http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/quick-index.html) and Karthik Ram's [material from the Canberra Software Carpentry R Bootcamp](https://github.com/swcarpentry/2013-10-09-canberra).  Anything good is there becuase of Jenny and Karthik.  Mistakes are all mine.*

These R lessons are divided into four sections. We will spend most of Monday, Jan 13 on R and will continue a bit more on the morning of Tuesday, Jan 14.
